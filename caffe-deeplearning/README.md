labelData - webapp to facilitate labeling images for training and testing

sceneTagging - finetune training files on tags (setup and results)

experimentation - random files to play around with as a starting point

A compact summary of the different elements of this summer intern project of subjective scene tagging at Carmera. Contains the webapp used to create a manually labeled dataset to begin training on, the files necessary for creating and training and network under the caffe framework, the testing validation files and results on the safety tag, as well as additional experimentation files that explored in testing caffe, imagenet, and webapps.
